  ## Challenges and Future Improvements 
  - Once you update a user's username, it will also change all of the associated thoughts to that updated username. - Add a 'followers' section, which is like friends, except it's only one way (that is, you can follow a user, but they don't have to follow you back). - Add a frontend.
