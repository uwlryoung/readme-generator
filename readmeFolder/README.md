# Python news Feed

  
  ## Description
  A news / blog website to make posts, comment on, and upvote posts, all made by using Python. 
  
To add another skill set to my coding.  This was a continuing education self-paced course provided by EdX's GW Fullstack Coding Bootcamp.   I learned how to set up a website with Python. It was very interesting to compare some of the differences between JavaScript/Node.js and Python to make a website.

  ## Installation
  Download the files from this github. Install venv files necessary for making websites based on Python. Furthermore, using pip, install these dependencies:

  ## Usage
  Run the command `python3 seeds.py` from the root file to seed your database. Use Flask to run the server from your local machine. This is a locally run server. 

  ## Credits
  EdX Bootcamp Full Stack Webdevelopment Continuation Courses provided the code and I followed step by step to learn how to build a website with Python.
